It is key that schools consider if there are criminal and/or sexual exploitation risks, in line with their safeguarding duties, and it will also be relevant to the decision to exclude. It is clear that the behaviours demonstrated because of being at risk of exploitation may be the same behaviours that put a child at risk of school exclusion. Therefore, the objective of preventing misbehaviour can be achieved by breaking the link between CHILD_NAME and their exploiter/s. An exclusion will only exacerbate these problems.",
